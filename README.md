This is a WIP GUI framework for ComputerCraft, designed to replace Flare.
Rather than focussing entirely on being flexible, this will also aim to be simple to use.
One way it will do this is by providing a format (Sheets Markup Language) similar to XML that will allow entire applications to be loaded.
