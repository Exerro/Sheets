Sheets is a framework that adds in some core elements commonly used in GUIs, like buttons, text input boxes, and scrollbars, and simplifies things like animation, styling, and debugging.

Sheets is a pretty large WIP at the moment. In the future, a markup language (`Sheets Markup Language`) will be included, so entire views will be able to be loaded from an xml-like format, as well as many more elements and layout helpers.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Exerro/Sheets/wiki) for more information.
