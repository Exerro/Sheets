Right now, Sheets adds in some core elements commonly used in GUIs, like buttons, text input boxes, and scrollbars.

In the future, a markup language (`Sheets Markup Language`) will be included, so entire views will be able to be loaded from an xml-like format.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Exerro/Sheets/wiki) for more information.

> Note, this uses the [graphics library](https://github.com/Exerro/CC-Graphics-Library). Also, Sheets is a pretty large WIP at the moment. Many more elements will be added, as well as layout helpers, and SML, so if things seem bare, it won't last long.
